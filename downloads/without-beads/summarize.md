## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

Create a concise summary of the current conversation suitable for transferring context to a new conversation.

## Output Format

Keep the summary concise and actionable - suitable for pasting into a new conversation to quickly restore context without needing the full conversation history.
