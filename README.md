**TDD workflow commands for Claude Code CLI.**

> "TDD helps you to pay attention to the right issues at the right time so you can make your designs cleaner, you can refine your designs as you learn." — Kent Beck

Claude Code supports [custom slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)—type `/foo` and Claude receives the contents of `foo.md` as instructions (from `.claude/commands/` in your repo or `~/.claude/commands/` in your home directory). This repo provides ready-made commands for Test-Driven Development workflows.

Custom commands are just a glorified copy-paste mechanism—but that simplicity is what makes them effective for establishing consistent development practices.

Instead of explaining TDD principles each session, type `/red` to write a failing test, `/green` to make it pass, `/refactor` to clean up. The commands guide Claude through each step methodically—you focus on what to build, Claude handles the how.

Want to go faster? Use `/cycle` to let Claude run the entire red-green-refactor sequence before checking in with you. For even more autonomy (your mileage may vary), `/tdd` gives Claude full discretion on when to advance between phases.

Also included are commands for commits, PRs, code reviews, and other tasks that come up during day-to-day development.

## Installation

```bash
npx @wbern/claude-instructions    # npm
```

```bash
pnpm dlx @wbern/claude-instructions   # pnpm
```

The interactive installer lets you choose:

- **Feature flags**: Enable optional integrations like [Beads MCP](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)
- **Scope**: User-level (global) or project-level installation

After installation, restart Claude Code if it's currently running.

### Adding to Your Repository

To automatically regenerate commands when teammates install dependencies, add it as a dev dependency with a postinstall script:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @wbern/claude-instructions
```

Then add a postinstall script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "claude-instructions --scope=project --overwrite"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wbern/claude-instructions": "^2.10.0"
  }
}
```

This ensures commands are regenerated whenever anyone runs `npm install`, `pnpm install`, or `yarn install`.

**CLI Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--scope=project` | Installation scope (project, user) |
| `--prefix=my-` | Add prefix to command names |
| `--commands=commit,red,green` | Install only specific commands |
| `--skip-template-injection` | Skip injecting project CLAUDE.md customizations |
| `--update-existing` | Only update already-installed commands |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite conflicting files without prompting |
| `--skip-on-conflict` | Skip conflicting files without prompting |
| `--flags=beads,github` | Enable feature flags (beads, github, gitlab, etc.) |
| `--allowed-tools=Bash(git diff:*),Bash(git status:*)` | Pre-approve tools for commands (non-interactive mode) |
| `--skills=tdd,commit` | Generate selected commands as skills (.claude/skills/) |
| `--help, -h` | Show help message |
| `--version, -v` | Show version number |

## Customizing Commands

You can inject project-specific instructions into generated commands by adding a `<claude-commands-template>` block to your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` file.

### Basic Usage

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# My Project

Other instructions here...

<claude-commands-template>
## Project-Specific Rules

- Always use pnpm instead of npm
- Run tests with `pnpm test`
</claude-commands-template>
```

When you run `claude-instructions`, the template content is appended to all generated commands.

### Targeting Specific Commands

Use the `commands` attribute to inject content only into specific commands:

```markdown
<claude-commands-template commands="commit,ask">
## Git Conventions

- Use conventional commits format
- Reference issue numbers in commits
</claude-commands-template>
```

This injects the content only into `commit.md` and `ask.md`.

### File Priority

The generator looks for template blocks in this order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (checked first)
2. `AGENTS.md` (fallback)

Only the first file found is used.

## Which Command Should I Use?

## Getting Started

### Quick Start: Your First TDD Cycle

Here's a simple example to get you started with the TDD workflow:

**1. Write a failing test (`/red`)**

```
You: /red add a function that validates email addresses

Claude: I'll write a failing test for email validation.
[Creates test file with a test that checks email validation]
[Runs test - shows it failing because function doesn't exist yet]
```

**2. Make it pass (`/green`)**

```
You: /green

Claude: I'll implement the minimal code to pass the test.
[Creates the email validation function with basic implementation]
[Runs test - shows it passing]
```

**3. Refactor for quality (`/refactor`)**

```
You: /refactor extract regex pattern to a constant

Claude: I'll refactor while keeping tests green.
[Extracts magic values, improves code structure]
[Runs tests - confirms they still pass]
```

### Complete Workflow Example

**Starting from a GitHub issue:**

```
/issue 123
```

Claude analyzes the GitHub issue and creates a TDD implementation plan showing what tests to write.

**Running a full TDD cycle:**

```
/cycle implement user authentication with password hashing
```

Claude executes the complete red-green-refactor cycle: writes a failing test, implements it, then refactors.

**Individual phases for more control:**

```
/red test that users can't login with wrong password
/green
/refactor move password verification to separate function
```

**Committing and creating PRs:**

```
/commit
```

Claude reviews changes, drafts a commit message following project standards, and creates the commit.

```
/ask
```

Claude analyzes commits, creates a PR with summary and test plan.

### What to Expect

- **`/red`** - Claude writes ONE failing test based on your description
- **`/green`** - Claude writes minimal implementation to pass the current failing test
- **`/refactor`** - Claude improves code structure without changing behavior
- **`/cycle`** - Claude runs all three phases in sequence for a complete feature

The commands enforce TDD discipline: you can't refactor with failing tests, can't write multiple tests at once, and implementation must match test requirements.

## Example Conversations

# Conversation: Solving "Find Closest to Zero" Code Challenge

**Summary:** User works through solving a code challenge: given a list of integers, find the closest to zero. If there is a tie, choose the positive value. (challenge from [cyber-dojo.org](https://cyber-dojo.org))

**Commands:** `/red` `/green` `/refactor`
**Legend:** 🔴 Red (test fails) | 🟢 Green (test passes) | 🔵 Refactor (cleanup)

---

👤 `/red` single element [1] returns 1

🔴 _writes test_

```typescript
expect(closestToZero([1])).toBe(1);
```

FAIL: closestToZero is not defined

👤 `/green`

🟢 _returns hardcoded 1_

```typescript
function closestToZero(nums: number[]): number {
  return 1; // minimal - only need to pass current test
}
```

✅ Test passes

👤 `/red` two numbers [3, 2] returns 2

🔴 _writes test_

```typescript
expect(closestToZero([3, 2])).toBe(2);
```

FAIL: expected 1 to be 2

👤 `/green`

🟢 _sorts and returns first_

```typescript
function closestToZero(nums: number[]): number {
  return nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)[0]; // minimal
}
```

✅ 2/2 tests pass

👤 `/red` with negative [-3, 2] returns 2

🔴 _writes test_

```typescript
expect(closestToZero([-3, 2])).toBe(2);
```

FAIL: expected -3 to be 2 (regular sort puts -3 first)

👤 `/green`

🟢 _sorts by absolute value_

```typescript
function closestToZero(nums: number[]): number {
  return nums.sort((a, b) => Math.abs(a) - Math.abs(b))[0];
}
```

✅ 3/3 tests pass

👤 `/red` exact tie [-2, 2] returns positive 2

🔴 _writes test_

```typescript
expect(closestToZero([-2, 2])).toBe(2);
```

FAIL: expected -2 to be 2 (returns first when tied)

👤 `/green`

🟢 _adds tie-breaking: prefer positive_

```typescript
function closestToZero(nums: number[]): number {
  return nums.sort((a, b) => {
    const diff = Math.abs(a) - Math.abs(b);
    return diff !== 0 ? diff : b - a;
  })[0];
}
```

✅ 4/4 tests pass

👤 `/refactor` extract helper and use iteration instead of sort

🔵 _extracts helper function for comparison logic_

```typescript
function isCloser(candidate: number, current: number): boolean {
  const candAbs = Math.abs(candidate);
  const currAbs = Math.abs(current);
  return candAbs < currAbs || (candAbs === currAbs && candidate > current);
}

function closestToZero(nums: number[]): number {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let closest = nums[0];
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (isCloser(num, closest)) {
      closest = num;
    }
  }
  return closest;
}
```

✅ 4/4 tests still pass

👤 `/refactor`

🔵 _uses reduce for more functional style_

```typescript
function closestToZero(nums: number[]): number {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  return nums.reduce((closest, num) =>
    isCloser(num, closest) ? num : closest,
  );
}
```

✅ 4/4 tests still pass
